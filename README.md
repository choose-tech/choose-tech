  <p align="center">Hand-picked comparisons for your next project.<p>
</p>

<hr />

Choose Tech is a free and open-source resource portal to help devs pick the right tech for their next project.

Choose Tech provides tooling for the community to create comparisons and keep them up to date. It's all made posible by our [Astro integration](https://github.com/choose-tech/astro-integration).

## Features

- Great tooling to manage comparisons and resources with almost no boilerplate
- Filtering
- Sorting (soon)
- Progressively enhanced UI powered by [Astro View Transitions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/)
- Icons through [iconify](https://iconify.design/)

## Contributing

## Development

To run this website locally, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) `18.14.1`. We recommend using something like `nvm` to manage node versions. Once installed, enable Corepack using `corepack enable`. It will install PNPM for you.

Start by installing the dependencies with `pnpm i --frozen-lockfile`, then start the local server with `pnpm dev`. That's it!

It's a standard [Astro](https://astro.build/) website, have a look at their [docs](https://docs.astro.build/) if you need more info!
